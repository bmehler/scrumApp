# scrumApp
A tool to organize the product backlog.

The scrumApp is based on PostgreSQL.
Create at least the database scrumApp_development.

You can start the application by running the command bin/rails server -b 0.0.0.0 from the scrumApp directory.

After the web server is started open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Have fun!
